# Roadmap to become a Data Scientist

## What's this list ?

It's hard to have a clear view on what to learn and what to know to be employable. Especially when you're not in a traditional cursus.

This list is a compilation of most-wanted skills for data scientist **based on online job offers**.

I took hundreds of data scientist job offers in **Paris, France**, in Novembre 2020. This list may not be representative of the most-wanted skills in other areas or countries.

The raw data extracted from job offers is visible in JobOffers.md.

The lists are **ordered by frequence of mentionning** in the offers.

### Production

Python was 2x more mentionned than R, but both are really demanded.

SQL is as demanded as R, it appears to be an essential skill.

Dashboarding in general is a top-demanded skill.

#### Languages

- **Python**.
- **R**.
- **C++**.

#### Libs

- **Pandas / Numpy**. Essential Python data handling libs.
- **Scikit-learn**.
- **Tensorflow / Keras**.
- **PyTorch**.
- **PySpark**. Connect your Python script to a Spark stack.
- **NLTK**. Neural language processing lib.
- **Scipy**.
- **MxNet**. Deep learning lib.
- **XGboost**. Gradient boosted decision trees in Pyhton and R.
- **Catboost**. Yandex boosted gradient decision trees in Python and R.
- **LGBM**. Microsoft boosted gradient decision trees in Python and R.
- **Prophet**. Facebook time series forecasting lib.
- **Libsvm**. Support vector machines in Python.

#### Tools

- **Apache Spark**. With Hive and AirFlow.
- **Hadoop**.
- **Tableau**.
- **Linux / Shell scripting**.
- **Git / Gitlab / Github**.
- **Docker**.
- **CD/CI**. Jenkins, Gitlab.
- **ElasticSearch**.
- **Excel**.

#### Clouds

- **Google Cloud**. Functions, storage, big query.
- **AWS**.

#### Database

- **SQL**.
- **NoSQL / Relational algebra**. Appears 5x less than SQL, but still interesting to learn.

### Soft skills

Soft skills were nearly as mentionned as "Python" or "Tensorflow", so they seem really important.

- **Communication**. Being able to explain complex algorithms to non-technical clients or other employees. Being able to write reports and documentation on your search work.
- **Self-organisation**. Being able to organize your work without direct instructions.
- **Business inteligence / CRM**. Being able to understand how AI can improve a business and client relation management.
- **Technological watch**. Being able to organise and documentate a technological watch so your company and employees are always open to state of the art technics.
