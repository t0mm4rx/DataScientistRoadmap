# Roadmap to become a Data Scientist

## What's this list ?

It's hard to have a clear view on what to learn and what to know to be employable. Especially when you're not in a classical university.

This list is a compilation of most-wanted skills for data scientist.

I took every job offer as a data scientist in **Paris, France**. This list may not be representative of the most-wanted skills in other areas or countries.

**Disclaimer**: skill labels can be unprecise or mis-classified as I don't know these topics.
